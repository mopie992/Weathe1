# RoadWeather - Route API requests to Passenger backend
# Frontend static files are served normally
# API requests (/api/*) are routed to Passenger Node.js app

# Enable rewrite engine
RewriteEngine On

# Route /api/* requests to Passenger backend
# Passenger will handle these through the backend Node.js app
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/api/
RewriteRule ^api/(.*)$ - [L]

# For Passenger to work, we need to tell it where the app is
# This is configured in Dreamhost panel, but we ensure requests reach it

# Serve static files normally (frontend)
# No rewrite needed - Apache will serve them by default
